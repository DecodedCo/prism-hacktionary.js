Prism-Hacktionary.js
====================

Prism-Hacktionary.js is a plugin for [Lea Verou's Prism.JS][prismjs] syntax highlighter.

It uses Mozilla's [Hacktionary][hacktionary], a list of short HTML/CSS definitions from MDN,
to add popovers explaining terms code when they are clicked. If Bootstrap is installed, it
will use Bootstrap popovers. If not, it will create its own popovers. Requires jQuery.
